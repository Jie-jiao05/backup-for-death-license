To create a histogram in R that displays the number of death licenses in Toronto and outside city limits by year, we will need to filter the dataset accordingly and then use ggplot2 to visualize the data. Here’s a step-by-step guide along with the code that follows your provided example:

Load Necessary Libraries: Make sure you have the required libraries installed and loaded.
Read the Data: Load your dataset using read_csv.
Data Manipulation: Filter the data to only include rows where place_of_death is either "Toronto" or "Outside City Limits". Group the data by year and place of death to summarize the death license counts.
Create the Histogram: Use ggplot to plot the data.
Here’s how you can implement this:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the data
data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Data manipulation to summarize death licenses by year and place of death
summary_data <- data |>
  filter(place_of_death %in% c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits")) |>
  group_by(year, place_of_death) |>
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses), .groups = "drop")

# Create the histogram
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = year, y = death_licenses, fill = place_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    fill = "Place of Death",
    caption = "Data source: Analysis Data."
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
Explanation:
Data Filtering: The filter function selects only the rows with "Toronto" or "Outside City Limits" as the place_of_death.
Grouping and Summarizing: The group_by function groups the data by year and place_of_death, and summarise calculates the total number of death licenses for each combination.
Histogram Creation:
geom_bar(stat = "identity") is used for creating a bar plot where the heights of the bars represent the values in death_licenses.
position = "dodge" separates the bars for each place_of_death for clarity.
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") provides a color palette for better visual differentiation.
This code will create a clear histogram that reflects the number of death licenses issued in Toronto and outside city limits over the specified years.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Let's debug the summarization process to ensure that we accurately summarize the death licenses by year and place of death. We want to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly and that we are not mistakenly aggregating values that shouldn't be summed together.

Steps to Correct the Summarization:
Ensure Data Integrity: Check if death_licenses are correctly recorded.
Verify Grouping: Make sure that the grouping and summarization is correct.
Check for Duplicates: If there are any duplicates that might affect the summation.
Let's modify the code to include some checks and ensure the correct summarization:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the data
data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Check the structure of the data to ensure it's read correctly
glimpse(data)

# Data manipulation to summarize death licenses by year and place of death
summary_data <- data |>
  filter(place_of_death %in% c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits")) |>
  group_by(year, place_of_death) |>
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# View the summarized data for verification
print(summary_data)

# Create the histogram
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = year, y = death_licenses, fill = place_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    fill = "Place of Death",
    caption = "Data source: Analysis Data."
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
Key Changes:
glimpse(data): This function will show the structure of the dataset, allowing you to verify that the data types are correct and that there are no unexpected values.
na.rm = TRUE: This argument in the sum function ensures that any NA values do not disrupt the summation process.
print(summary_data): This line allows you to see the summarized data before plotting, helping you verify that the summarization is correct.
Additional Debugging Tips:
After running the code, look at the printed summary_data. Ensure that the counts make sense based on your dataset.
If the values still seem off, double-check the input data for any inconsistencies or unexpected values in death_licenses or place_of_death.
This approach will help ensure that the data is correctly summarized and will allow you to identify any potential issues.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure that we accurately capture the number of death licenses for the years 2012 and 2024 from your dataset, we need to filter for these specific years after performing the summarization. Here’s the complete code that will achieve this:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the data
data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Check the structure of the data to ensure it's read correctly
glimpse(data)

# Data manipulation to summarize death licenses by year and place of death
summary_data <- data |>
  filter(place_of_death %in% c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits"), 
         year %in% c(2012, 2024)) |>  # Filter for years 2012 and 2024
  group_by(year, place_of_death) |>
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# View the summarized data for verification
print(summary_data)

# Create the histogram
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = year, y = death_licenses, fill = place_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    fill = "Place of Death",
    caption = "Data source: Analysis Data."
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
Code Breakdown:
Filtering for Specific Years: The line year %in% c(2012, 2024) ensures that we only include data for the years 2012 and 2024 during the summarization.
Summarization: The summarise function aggregates the total number of death licenses by year and place_of_death.
Printing Summary Data: The print(summary_data) line allows you to see the output of the summarization, which should confirm that the counts for 2012 and 2024 are correct.
Histogram: The final ggplot code visualizes the summarized data, allowing for easy comparison of the number of death licenses in Toronto and outside city limits for the specified years.
Additional Tips:
Make sure that your dataset indeed contains entries for the years 2012 and 2024. If there are no entries for these years, the output will reflect that.
After running the code, inspect summary_data to confirm the results before looking at the plot. This ensures that you have the correct numbers for both years.

glimpse(data)

# Data manipulation to summarize death licenses for 2014
summary_data_2014 <- data |>
  filter(place_of_death %in% c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits"), 
         year == 2014) |>
  group_by(place_of_death) |>
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# View the summarized data for verification
print(summary_data_2014)

# Calculate the difference
difference <- summary_data_2014$death_licenses[summary_data_2014$place_of_death == "Toronto"] -
              summary_data_2014$death_licenses[summary_data_2014$place_of_death == "Outside City Limits"]

# Output the result
cat("The difference in the number of death licenses in 2014 between Toronto and Outside City Limits is:", difference)
Code Breakdown:
Filtering for 2014: The line year == 2014 ensures that we only include data from that specific year.
Summarization: The group_by function groups the data by place_of_death, and the summarise function calculates the total number of death licenses for each location.
Calculating the Difference:
The difference is calculated by subtracting the number of death licenses for Outside City Limits from that of Toronto.
Output: The cat function displays the result clearly in the console.
Note:
Ensure that there are entries for 2014 in your dataset for both locations; otherwise, the result might not reflect the expected counts. The printed summary_data_2014 will help you verify the totals before calculating the difference.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To analyze the number of death licenses by month for each place of death (Toronto and Outside City Limits), we can summarize the data on a monthly basis. The following steps outline the process:

Extract Month Information: We need to make sure that we have a month column in our dataset.
Summarize the Data: Group the data by month and place of death, and calculate the total number of death licenses for each combination.
Create a Plot: Use ggplot to visualize the data.
Here’s the R code that implements this:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the data
data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Data manipulation to summarize death licenses by month and place of death
summary_monthly_data <- data |>
  filter(place_of_death %in% c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits")) |>
  group_by(month, place_of_death) |>
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Check the summarized data
print(summary_monthly_data)

# Create the bar plot to show death licenses by month
ggplot(summary_monthly_data, aes(x = factor(month, levels = 1:12), y = death_licenses, fill = place_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    title = "Monthly Death Licenses in Toronto vs Outside City Limits",
    fill = "Place of Death",
    caption = "Data source: Analysis Data."
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +  # Use abbreviated month names
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
Code Breakdown:
Data Filtering and Grouping: The code filters the data for Toronto and Outside City Limits, then groups the data by month and place_of_death, summarizing the total death licenses.
Bar Plot Creation:
aes(x = factor(month, levels = 1:12), ...) ensures that the months are displayed in the correct order.
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") creates side-by-side bars for each place of death.
scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) replaces the numeric month labels with abbreviated month names (Jan, Feb, etc.).
Customization: The labs() function customizes the titles and labels for clarity, while scale_fill_brewer() applies a color palette.
Final Note:
Running this code will produce a bar plot that displays the number of death licenses issued each month, allowing for a clear comparison between Toronto and Outside City Limits. You can analyze seasonal trends or differences in licensing across the months effectively.

summary_monthly_data <- data |>
  filter(place_of_death %in% c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits")) |>
  group_by(month, place_of_death) |>
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create a complete month-year combination for plotting
full_months <- expand.grid(month = 1:12, place_of_death = c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits"))

# Join with the summary data to ensure all months are represented
summary_monthly_data_complete <- full_months |>
  left_join(summary_monthly_data, by = c("month", "place_of_death")) |>
  replace_na(list(death_licenses = 0))  # Replace NAs with 0 for missing months

# Check the summarized data for verification
print(summary_monthly_data_complete)

# Create the bar plot to show death licenses by month
ggplot(summary_monthly_data_complete, aes(x = factor(month, levels = 1:12), y = death_licenses, fill = place_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    title = "Monthly Death Licenses in Toronto vs Outside City Limits",
    fill = "Place of Death",
    caption = "Data source: Analysis Data."
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +  # Use abbreviated month names
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
Key Changes:
Complete Month-Year Combination:
The expand.grid(month = 1:12, place_of_death = c("Toronto", "Outside City Limits")) creates a complete set of all months for both locations.
Joining with Summary Data:
The left_join() ensures that all combinations of months and places of death are present in the final dataset, even if some months have no death licenses recorded.
Replacing NAs:
The replace_na(list(death_licenses = 0)) ensures that any missing months will have a count of zero for death licenses.
Final Note:
This code will now ensure that the bar plot includes all months from January to December, allowing you to see the death licenses for each month and how they compare between Toronto and Outside City Limits, including months with zero occurrences.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a scatter plot using your dataset and analyze its contributions, you will need to decide which variables to plot against each other. A scatter plot is useful for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables.

Here’s an example of how to create a scatter plot using the ggplot2 library in R, assuming you want to visualize the relationship between death_licenses and year, while differentiating between the place_of_death (Toronto and Outside City Limits).

R Code for Scatter Plot
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = year, y = death_licenses, color = place_of_death)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    title = "Scatter Plot of Death Licenses by Year",
    color = "Place of Death",
    caption = "Data source: Analysis Data."
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
Code Breakdown:
Data Aesthetics: The aes() function sets the x-axis to year, the y-axis to death_licenses, and colors the points based on place_of_death.
Plotting Points: geom_point(alpha = 0.7) creates the scatter plot with slightly transparent points for better visibility of overlapping points.
Customization: labs() customizes the labels, and scale_color_brewer() applies a color palette for better visual distinction.
Contributions of the Scatter Plot:
Understanding Relationships:

The scatter plot allows you to visually assess the relationship between year and death_licenses. You can observe trends, such as whether the number of death licenses has increased or decreased over time.
Identifying Patterns:

By differentiating points by place_of_death, you can easily see if there are distinct patterns or trends for Toronto versus Outside City Limits. For example, if Toronto consistently has more death licenses, this could indicate urban factors influencing the data.
Highlighting Outliers:

Scatter plots can help identify outliers, such as years with an unusually high or low number of death licenses. Understanding these anomalies can lead to further investigation into specific years or events that may have impacted the data.
Informing Policy Decisions:

The insights gained from the scatter plot can inform public health policies or resource allocation. For instance, if there's a trend showing an increase in death licenses in certain areas, it may prompt health authorities to investigate further or enhance support services.
Facilitating Further Analysis:

The scatter plot serves as a basis for additional statistical analyses, such as regression analysis, to quantify the relationship between the variables.
Final Note:
Make sure to inspect your data for any potential issues (like missing values) that might affect the scatter plot. Adjust the code as necessary to suit your specific variables and analytical needs.

fit in beta distribution

3/3

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Fitting a Beta distribution to your data can be done using the fitdistrplus package in R, which allows for easy fitting of different distributions to your data. Here’s how you can fit a Beta distribution to your death_licenses data.

Steps to Fit a Beta Distribution
Prepare the Data: Ensure that your data is suitable for fitting a Beta distribution. The Beta distribution is defined on the interval (0, 1), so you might need to normalize your death_licenses data accordingly.
Fit the Beta Distribution: Use the fitdist() function from the fitdistrplus package.
Visualize the Fit: You can compare the fitted distribution with your empirical data.
R Code to Fit a Beta Distribution
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(fitdistrplus)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Filter the data for relevant analysis
death_licenses <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(place_of_death == "Toronto") %>%  # Change to "Outside City Limits" if needed
  pull(death_licenses)

# Normalize the data to (0, 1)
# Avoiding division by zero; adjust the normalization if necessary
min_val <- min(death_licenses)
max_val <- max(death_licenses)
normalized_death_licenses <- (death_licenses - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)

# Fit Beta distribution
fit <- fitdist(normalized_death_licenses, "beta")

# Print the summary of the fit
summary(fit)

# Plot the fit
ggplot(data.frame(x = normalized_death_licenses), aes(x)) +
  geom_density(aes(y = ..count..), alpha = 0.5) + 
  stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(shape1 = fit$estimate[1], shape2 = fit$estimate[2]), 
                color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Density of Normalized Death Licenses with Fitted Beta Distribution",
    x = "Normalized Death Licenses",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Code Breakdown:
Load Libraries: Ensure that the necessary libraries are loaded.
Prepare the Data:
The code filters the cleaned_data to get death_licenses for Toronto (you can change it for Outside City Limits if desired).
The data is normalized to the interval (0, 1).
Fit the Beta Distribution:
The fitdist() function fits a Beta distribution to the normalized data.
Output the Summary: The summary of the fitted distribution parameters (shape1 and shape2) is printed.
Visualize the Fit:
The density of the normalized death_licenses is plotted, along with the fitted Beta distribution in red.
Contributions of Fitting a Beta Distribution:
Understanding Distribution: Fitting a Beta distribution can help understand how the death licenses are distributed, particularly in relation to bounded intervals.
Parameter Interpretation: The parameters of the Beta distribution (shape1 and shape2) can provide insights into the distribution's behavior, such as its skewness and modality.
Predictive Modeling: A fitted Beta distribution can be useful for predictive modeling in contexts where death licenses are involved, allowing for the simulation of future values.
Statistical Inference: The fitted distribution can be used for hypothesis testing or confidence interval estimation regarding death licenses.
Final Note:
Ensure that the normalization step makes sense for your specific analysis context. The Beta distribution fitting assumes the data is continuous and bounded between 0 and 1, so careful consideration is needed when normalizing the data.

When analyzing the number of death licenses per month, it's essential to consider the nature of your data and the appropriate statistical distribution to use. Here’s a brief overview of suitable distributions for this type of data:

1. Beta Distribution
Use Case: The Beta distribution is used for continuous data bounded between 0 and 1. It may not be suitable for counts of death licenses, especially since these counts can be whole numbers and can exceed 1.
Conclusion: Generally not appropriate for analyzing counts of death licenses directly.
2. Poisson Distribution
Use Case: The Poisson distribution is often used to model count data, particularly for events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It assumes that counts are independent and that the mean equals the variance.
Conclusion: Suitable for modeling the number of death licenses per month if the data follows these assumptions.
3. Negative Binomial Distribution
Use Case: If your data is over-dispersed (i.e., the variance exceeds the mean), the Negative Binomial distribution may be a better fit. It can model the count data and is particularly useful when the data has a higher variability.
Conclusion: Use this if the Poisson model does not fit well.
4. Zero-Inflated Models
Use Case: If there are many zero counts (months with no death licenses), a zero-inflated model (either Poisson or Negative Binomial) could be appropriate. These models account for excess zeros in the data.
Conclusion: Consider this if you observe a significant number of months with zero death licenses.
Analysis Recommendations
For analyzing death licenses per month, the following approach is suggested:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the monthly counts to assess their distribution and check for over-dispersion or the presence of many zeros.
Fit Appropriate Distributions:

Fit both the Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions to your monthly death license data and compare the fits.
Use AIC/BIC or likelihood ratio tests to determine which model better fits your data.
Use Count Regression Models:

If you decide on the Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution, consider using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to analyze the impact of time (months) or other covariates on the number of death licenses.
Example of Fitting a Poisson and Negative Binomial Model
Here’s how you could fit both models using R:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(MASS)  # For Negative Binomial model
library(broom) # For tidying the output

# Read the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Summarize the data by month
monthly_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses), .groups = 'drop')

# Fit Poisson regression model
poisson_model <- glm(death_licenses ~ factor(month), data = monthly_data, family = "poisson")

# Fit Negative Binomial model
nb_model <- glm.nb(death_licenses ~ factor(month), data = monthly_data)

# Compare the two models
summary(poisson_model)
summary(nb_model)

# Use AIC to compare the models
aic_poisson <- AIC(poisson_model)
aic_nb <- AIC(nb_model)

cat("AIC for Poisson model:", aic_poisson, "\n")
cat("AIC for Negative Binomial model:", aic_nb, "\n")
Conclusion
Selection of Distribution: Based on your data characteristics and the results of the fit, you can choose the most appropriate distribution.
Modeling Approach: The Poisson or Negative Binomial regression models will allow you to explore trends and factors affecting the number of death licenses across months effectively.

Attaching package: ‘MASS’

The following object is masked from ‘package:dplyr’:

    select
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The message you received indicates that the select function from the dplyr package is being masked by the MASS package. This means that when you call select(), R will use the one from the MASS package unless you specify otherwise.

Resolving the Masking Issue
Namespace Specification: If you need to use the select function from dplyr after loading MASS, you can specify the package directly using the :: operator. For example, use dplyr::select() instead of just select().

Loading Order: You can also control which functions are available by adjusting the order in which you load the packages. However, this is less common and not generally recommended, as you may inadvertently lose access to useful functions.

Example of Using Namespace Specification
Here’s how you can modify your code to ensure you are using the correct select function from dplyr:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)  # This loads dplyr and ggplot2 among others
library(here)
library(MASS)  # For Negative Binomial model

# Read the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Summarize the data by month using dplyr::select if needed
monthly_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses), .groups = 'drop')

# Fit Poisson regression model
poisson_model <- glm(death_licenses ~ factor(month), data = monthly_data, family = "poisson")

# Fit Negative Binomial model
nb_model <- glm.nb(death_licenses ~ factor(month), data = monthly_data)

# Compare the two models
summary(poisson_model)
summary(nb_model)

# Use AIC to compare the models
aic_poisson <- AIC(poisson_model)
aic_nb <- AIC(nb_model)

cat("AIC for Poisson model:", aic_poisson, "\n")
cat("AIC for Negative Binomial model:", aic_nb, "\n")
Summary
Masking is Normal: Masking is common when using multiple packages in R. It happens when two packages have functions with the same name.
Specify as Needed: Using dplyr::select() will ensure you are using the function from the dplyr package, avoiding confusion.

To fit a Poisson regression model to your monthly death license data and visualize the results, you can follow these steps:

Fit the Poisson regression model.
Predict the expected death licenses using the fitted model.
Create a plot to visualize the actual counts alongside the predicted counts from the model.
R Code to Fit a Poisson Model and Plot
Here’s how you can implement this in R:

r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(MASS)  # For Negative Binomial model

# Read the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Summarize the data by month
monthly_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses), .groups = 'drop')

# Fit Poisson regression model
poisson_model <- glm(death_licenses ~ factor(month), data = monthly_data, family = "poisson")

# Predict death licenses using the fitted model
monthly_data <- monthly_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_death_licenses = predict(poisson_model, type = "response"))

# Create a plot to visualize the actual vs predicted values
ggplot(monthly_data, aes(x = factor(month), y = death_licenses)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "Actual"), size = 3) +  # Actual data points
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_death_licenses, color = "Predicted"), size = 1) +  # Fitted line
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Actual vs Predicted Death Licenses per Month",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
Code Breakdown:
Data Preparation:

The data is grouped by year and month to summarize the total number of death licenses.
Model Fitting:

The Poisson regression model is fitted using glm(), where death_licenses is modeled as a function of the month.
Predictions:

The predicted values from the model are obtained using the predict() function and added to the monthly_data DataFrame.
Visualization:

A scatter plot is created with actual death license counts as points and the predicted values as a line. The colors distinguish between actual and predicted values.
Interpretation of the Plot:
Actual Data Points: The blue points represent the actual number of death licenses for each month.
Predicted Line: The red line indicates the predicted counts based on the Poisson model.
Trends: You can assess how well the model fits the actual data by comparing the alignment of the predicted line with the actual points. If the model fits well, the red line should closely follow the blue points.
This visualization will help you evaluate the performance of the Poisson regression model in explaining the monthly variation in death licenses. If you observe that the predicted values significantly deviate from the actual counts, it may suggest exploring other modeling approaches or considering additional predictors.

measure in different year
ChatGPT said:

To analyze and visualize the number of death licenses by month across different years, you can modify the previous approach. You'll fit a Poisson regression model for each year and then plot the results to compare trends over time.

Here’s how you can do this in R:

R Code to Fit Poisson Models by Year and Plot
r
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("~/Paper 1/starter_folder-main/data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Summarize the data by year and month
monthly_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(death_licenses = sum(death_licenses), .groups = 'drop')

# Fit Poisson regression model for each year
poisson_models <- monthly_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  do(model = glm(death_licenses ~ factor(month), data = ., family = "poisson"))

# Predict death licenses for each year using the fitted models
predictions <- monthly_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(predicted_death_licenses = predict(poisson_models$model[[1]], newdata = ., type = "response"))

# Create a plot to visualize the actual vs predicted values by year
ggplot(predictions, aes(x = factor(month), y = death_licenses, group = year)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "Actual"), size = 3) +  # Actual data points
  geom_line(aes(y = predicted_death_licenses, color = "Predicted"), size = 1) +  # Fitted line
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 1) +  # Create separate panels for each year
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Actual vs Predicted Death Licenses per Month by Year",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Number of Death Licenses",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "blue", "Predicted" = "red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
Code Breakdown:
Data Preparation:

The data is grouped by year and month to summarize the total number of death licenses.
Model Fitting:

A separate Poisson regression model is fitted for each year using do(). This allows you to create individual models for each year's data.
Predictions:

Predictions are made for each month within each year, and the results are added to the predictions DataFrame.
Visualization:

A ggplot2 plot is created, with points for actual death licenses and lines for predicted values. The plot is faceted by year, allowing you to see trends for each year separately.
Interpretation of the Plot:
Actual vs Predicted: Each panel represents a different year, showing the actual counts (blue points) versus the predicted counts (red lines).
Trends Over Time: You can assess how the number of death licenses changes across months within each year and how well the model captures these trends.
Comparison Between Years: By faceting the plot, you can easily compare trends and see if there are any notable differences in patterns of death licenses from year to year.
This approach will help you to analyze and visualize the differences in death licenses across months and years effectively. If you notice significant deviations in the predicted values, consider exploring other models or factors that may influence these counts.
